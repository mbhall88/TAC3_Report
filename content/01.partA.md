## Part A: Progress Report {.page_break_before}

Format options:
- If the student has not yet published a first author paper, the third report should be written in a first author draft paper format. If there are multiple projects, the different projects should be summarized. A bullet-point thesis outline should also be provided (max one page). 
- Alternatively, if the fellow has already published a first author paper, the TAC3 report can instead be presented as a detailed thesis outline including key results. This is recommended for students who work on multiple projects and whose publication(s) do not cover all projects.
